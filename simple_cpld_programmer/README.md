Experimental Arduino code to program CPLDs -- in progress
=========================================================

This code in this folder can be used to program Xilinx XC9500XL series CPLDs
with only an Arduino Leonardo or Pro Micro board and some jumper cables (i.e. no
vendor specific boards or JTAG hardware).

See [../notes/pld_programming_and_jtag.md](../notes/pld_programming_and_jtag.md)
for usage instructions.
